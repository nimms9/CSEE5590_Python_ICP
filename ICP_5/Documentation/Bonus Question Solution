In the dataset diabetes.csv the age column has null values which is filled with mean of all ages. 
I think it's a better idea for filling null values as it is the values of age.
Because there are many options we could consider when replacing a missing value, for example:
A constant value that has meaning within the domain, such as 0, distinct from all other values.
A value from another randomly selected record.
A mean, median or mode value for the column.
A value estimated by another predictive model.
These options can be used to fill the null values in a dataset but it is dependent on what kind of data are you dealing with. 
As the data is different when you are dealing with, you need to analyse and rethink which way is better to fill the null values 
in a dataset.
For the dataset given in the question I think mean is the better option(as given in question) for filling the null values which is 
relevant to the age column in the dataset.
