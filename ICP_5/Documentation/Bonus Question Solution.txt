-->In the dataset diabetes.csv the age column has null values which is filled with mean of all ages. 
-->I think it's a better idea for filling null values as it is the values of age.
-->Because there are many options we could consider when replacing a missing value, for example:
1. A constant value that has meaning within the domain, such as 0, distinct from all other values.
2. A value from another randomly selected record.
3. A mean, median or mode value for the column.
4. A value estimated by another predictive model.
5. These options can be used to fill the null values in a dataset but it is dependent on what kind of data are you dealing with. 
-->As the data is different when you are dealing with, you need to analyse and rethink which way is better to fill the null values in a dataset.
-->For the dataset given in the question I think mean is the better option(as given in question) for filling the null values which is relevant to the age column in the dataset.
